# Tumorator
A mobile application designed to make cancer testing and treatment a less painful journey.

Regular or even irregular health check up culture is nearly non-existent in Iraq. millions of Iraqi people are walking around clueless to their current health development, many of them don’t even know their own blood type. I don’t think I need to explain how dangerous this can be to the overall health of the society as a whole.
One of the largest problems is the spread of cancer amongst the population and without the early check-ups it probably means the diagnosis would be too little too late.
This is why Tumorator exists; which gets its name from the words Tumour and terminator.

Tumorator aims to provide easy access to cancer testing centres, educate the masses on the importance of regular health check-ups, and offer them a quick and easy form of reliable information.

We are turning our focus on Breast and Testicular cancers as they are the two most common types of cancer across the world and Iraq is no exception.

To achieve our goals we adopted a simple and straight to the point approach.

## Sign Up page
When the app is first opened the user is greeted with the sign-up window which requires the first and last name and gender of the user, it also asks the user a very important question, “Do you have cancer?” and depending on their answer they are segregated to the appropriate section.

We do not require an Email or phone number as they aren’t particularly needed and adding them could hender the simple and stright to the point approach we’re aiming for.

If the user is answers with “Yes” to that question they are directed to the Community tab where two main part exist, the community highlight and the events.
The community highlight is a showcase of a random user porfile where other users can see to get inspired or maybe hopeful.
While the event section has a slew of community support groups for people already afflicted by cancer or effected by it in anyway possible.
