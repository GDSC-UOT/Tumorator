### A mobile application designed to make cancer testing and treatment a less painful journey.

#### This is a project made for Google solution challage 2023

## Overview

Regular or even irregular health check up culture is nearly non-existent in Iraq. millions of Iraqi people are walking around clueless to their current health development, many of them don’t even know their own blood type. I don’t think I need to explain how dangerous this can be to the overall health of the society as a whole.
One of the largest problems is the spread of cancer amongst the population and without the early check-ups it probably means the diagnosis would be too little too late.
This is why Tumorator exists; which gets its name from the words Tumour and terminator.
Tumorator aims to provide easy access to cancer testing centres, educate the masses on the importance of regular health check-ups, and offer them a quick and easy form of reliable information.
We are turning our focus on Breast and Testicular cancers as they are the two most common types of cancer across the world and Iraq is no exception.
To achieve our goals we adopted a simple and straight to the point approach where a user is asked a simple question at signup and gets directed to the approprate section.
